net: thunderx: add support for PTP clock

This series adds support for IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol
to Cavium ethernet driver.

The first patch adds support for the Precision Time Protocol Clocks and
Timestamping coprocessor (PTP) found on Cavium processors.
It registers a new PTP clock in the PTP core and provides functions
to use the counter in BGX, TNS, GTI, and NIC blocks.

The second patch introduces support for the PTP protocol to the
Cavium ThunderX ethernet driver.
